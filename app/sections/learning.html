                <h1 class="title">The Myths of Dog Adoption</h1>
                <p class="text">Did you know that most dogs do not have a home due to no fault of their own? It is a common myth to think that all dogs up for adoption in shelters and rescues are damaged in some way. But, nothing could be less true! Dog shelters and rescues are full of lovable, active and healthy adoptable dogs just waiting for someone to take them home. A majority of dogs are given up when their prior owner can no longer afford the financial requirements to keep them, got divorced, had a death in the family or other unexpected change in their family situation, or didn't realize how much time & attention a dog adoption deserves and needs. </p>
                <!-- <h1 class="title">Time</h1> -->
                <!-- <p class="text">One of the main requirements of your new pet will be time. Within the first months of the adoption, your pet will require a lot of attention, but as time goes on they will not need you as much.<strong> Be ready to sacrifice time in the beginning</strong>, but remember that the more time and patience you invest in your pet from the start, the more behaved he will become.</p> -->
                <h1 class="title">Some Rescue Dogs Are Already Trained for a Home</h1>
                <p class="text">Even though living in a dog rescue isn't ideal, most rescues (and some shelters) are assisting the dogs in more ways than just keeping it alive. Dogs can be socialized with other animals that help make them kinder and playful with all types of animals. Many rescue organizations use foster homes, where puppies and kittens for adoption are socialized with children and other dogs and cats, and given essential obedience training before they go to their new homes. This makes the transition to your home much easier for both pet and owner.</p>
